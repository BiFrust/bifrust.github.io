## How upgrading works:
BiFrust is currently in its hyper release cycle while in beta. You may see a frequent number of updates pushed. These updates are in place and get invoked on app launch.


When an update becomes available the following notification will popup:

<img src="/assets/images/appUpdateAvailable.png" alt="Unblock Installer" width="250" height="300"/>

Click on **Download Updated Client**

<img src="/assets/images/appUpdate.png" alt="Unblock Installer" width="250" height="300"/>

Once the download finishes, the installer will run. Once the installation finishes you can launch the updated app.
