## Task Options:

### Data Collision:

While copying data around, you will run into scenario where you will attempt to copy files over to a location where files with same name exist. You can either choose to skip over these files, replace them or keep both (coming soon).

### Data Filtering: 

You may want to omit certain files to be part of the copy process or your especially want to target specific files to be copied over. You can select the either from the drop down and enter the extensions of the files.
